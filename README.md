# SignalProcessingNotebooks

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks written in the Julia language (v1.4.1):
* julia_prerequisites.ipynb
* fourier_transform.ipynb
* wavelet_transform.ipynb
The Fourier and Wavelet Transform notebooks explain the inner workings of each concept by combining both theory and practice. The Julia Prerequisites  notebook contains all the Julia you need to know in order to follow them. It's made for people with some to little experience with numerical computing programming languages.  

You can view the notebooks on GitHub without installing anything just by clicking on them. Additionally you can view, interact **and** execute your own code by clicking on this binder badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spirosbax/SignalProcessingNotebooks/d0e5454ab071ef987631d9e209832a646cb1bf8c)
I must warn you however that binder startup can take a couple of minutes.
